/*ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

You are given an object containing students and their scores in different subjects.

const students = {
  Alex: [85, 90, 78],
  Bella: [92, 88, 95],
  Chris: [70, 75, 80],
  Diana: [60, 65, 70]
};

Your Task:

Use a for loop â†’ Print each student's average score.

Use a while loop â†’ Count how many students have an average score above 80.

Use a do...while loop â†’ Print numbers from 1 to the number of students.

Use a for...in loop â†’ Print each student's name.

Use a for...of loop â†’ For each student, print all their subject scores.

ðŸ”¹ Expected Output (example)
Alex â†’ Average: 84.33
Bella â†’ Average: 91.67
Chris â†’ Average: 75.00
Diana â†’ Average: 65.00

Students above 80: 2
