/* ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:

You are given a shop order system where each customer has placed multiple orders with prices.

const orders = {
  Alex: [120.50, 89.99, 45.00],
  Bella: [300.00, 150.25],
  Chris: [50.00, 60.00, 70.00, 100.00],
  Diana: [500.00]
};

Your Tasks:

for loop â†’ For each customer, calculate their total spending.

while loop â†’ Count how many customers spent more than 200.

do...while loop â†’ Print numbers from 1 to the number of customers.

for...in loop â†’ Print each customerâ€™s name.

for...of loop â†’ For each customer, print all their order values.

Bonus Challenge â†’ Find the customer who spent the most (use any loop you want).

ðŸ”¹ Expected Output:
Alex â†’ Total: 255.49
Bella â†’ Total: 450.25
Chris â†’ Total: 280.00
Diana â†’ Total: 500.00

Customers who spent more than 200: 3

Customer: Alex
Orders: 120.5, 89.99, 45
Customer: Bella
Orders: 300, 150.25
Customer: Chris
Orders: 50, 60, 70, 100
Customer: Diana
Orders: 500

Top Spender: Diana â†’ 500.00


ðŸ‘‰ This one is more real-world (like a POS system), not just numbers.
Do you want me to also write the full JavaScript solution code for this complex problem, or keep it as a challenge for you to solve? */
